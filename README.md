# Customer_Segregation_Kmeans
This repository showcases a project on customer segmentation using the KMeans clustering algorithm.
The dataset contains demographic and spending behavior information of customers, including attributes such as CustomerID, Gender, Age, Annual Income (k$), and Spending Score (1-100). The goal is to group customers into distinct clusters to gain actionable insights into customer behavior and preferences.

**Dataset Features:**
**CustomerID:** Unique identifier for each customer
**Gender:** Gender of the customer
**Age:** Age of the customer
**Annual Income (k$):** Customer's annual income in thousands of dollars
**Spending Score (1-100):** Score assigned based on customer spending behavior

**Clustering Process:**
Used KMeans Clustering to segment customers into 5 clusters, determined using the Elbow Method.
Visualized the Elbow Graph to identify the optimal number of clusters.
Explored relationships between features such as Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score to understand cluster characteristics.

**Deliverables:**
Code implementation for the clustering algorithm.
Visualizations of the clusters and feature distributions.
Insights into each customer segment's demographics and spending patterns.

**Tech Stack:**
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
This project is ideal for understanding customer behavior and can be used to create targeted marketing strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, or optimize business processes.
